# Matlab-Read-Image-Perform-Convolution
This project was developed during my Computer Vision course. Our task was to write a Matlab script that applies various filters to an image supplied in Matlab's Image Processing Toolbox. Additionally, we needed to write a script that uses loops and matrix multiplication to create a filter that keeps the image the same and another filter that moves the image's pixels to the left.
